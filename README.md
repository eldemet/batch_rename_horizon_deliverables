# Batch Rename of Horizon Deliverables

Rename a folder of PDFs comprised of your project deliverables in a common way. For example, the European Commissions portal for the Horizon projects renames all uploaded deliverables as "Attachment_0.pdf", therefore, when downloading all the submitted deliverables, it is not possible to distinguish which PDF corresponds to which deliverable.

This simple code reads the first page of the PDF to find the name of the Deliverable X.X, and then renames the filename based on a dictionary.

To run, put the Python script in a folder with PDFs and execute.

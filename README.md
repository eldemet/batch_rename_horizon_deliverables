# Batch Rename of Horizon Deliverables

Rename a folder of PDFs comprised of your project deliverables in a common way. For example the European Commissions portal for the Horizon projects renames all uploaded deliverables as "Attachment_0.pdf", and therefore downloading all the submited deliverables it is not possible to distinguish what is which.

This simple code reads the first page of the PDF to find the name of the Deliverable X.X, and the renames the filename based on a dictionary.

To run, put the python script in a folder with PDFs and exeute.

Hope this helps.
